# WebApp-MBTA
 This is a repository for Charlotte Chen and Jenny Ma's Web App Developement project.

## Project Writeup and Reflection

**1. Project Overview**   

 This project develops a web application that leverages the Mapbox and MBTA APIs to determine the latitude and longitude of a user-specified location and identify the three nearest MBTA stops, along with their wheelchair accessibility status. Additionally, the application provides a predictive model for the next train departure time and how long it will be before the train leaves. Flask was utilized to create a user-friendly website that prompts the user for the desired location, and presents the 3 nearest MBTA stop information on a separate page, while also informing the user if no relevant MBTA stops were found.

**2. Reflection** (~3 paragraphs + screenshots)

After you finish the project, Please write a short document for reflection.

1. Discuss the **process** point of view, including what went well and what could be improved. Provide reflections on topics such as project scoping, testing, and anything else that could have helped the team succeed.

2. Discuss your **team's work division**, including how the work was planned to be divided and how it actually happened. Address any issues that arose while working together and how they were addressed. Finally, discuss what you would do differently next time.

3. Discuss from a learning perspective, what you learned through this project and how you'll use what you learned going forward. Reflect on how ChatGPT helped you and what you wish you knew beforehand that could have helped you succeed. Consider including screenshots to demonstrate your project's progress and development.

 In this project, we found ChatGpt not very useful. Due to the project's numerous APIs and various types of documentation, we found it difficult to approach ChatGpt for the information we required. Instead of letting ChatGpt generate the code, we provided it with our code and asked it what the best approach was to achieve a particular goal, and then modifying it according to the provided method. Here is an example of the answer generated:

**Note**: 
- Begin by including the names of all team members at the top of the document.
- Make the `README.md` file clear and concise. There is no need to use fancy words or ChatGPT.
